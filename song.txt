In the shadows, where the echoes play,
Lost in the night, we find our way,
Every step, a rhythm in time,
Searching for the spark, the light that shines.

Winds may blow, and the skies may cry,
But we'll keep walking, you and I,
Hand in hand, we'll brave the storm,
Together we'll find a world reborn.
